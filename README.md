# Register and Login Page Using Variables

A simple web project that simulates user registration and login functionality using JavaScript variables. This project demonstrates basic user data handling and validation without any backend or database, suitable for learning purposes.

## Features

- Register a new user by entering a username and password.
- Login by verifying entered credentials against stored variables.
- Basic validation and error messages for empty or incorrect input.
- Data is stored temporarily in variables and lost when the page is refreshed.

## How It Works

- On registration, user credentials are saved into JavaScript variables.
- On login, input credentials are compared to stored variables for verification.
- If credentials match, a success message is shown.
- If credentials do not match or fields are empty, appropriate error messages are displayed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Limitations

- User data is not persistent and will be lost on page reload or closing the browser.
- Supports only one user at a time due to variable-based storage.
- Not secure for real-world applications (no encryption or backend).

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Use the register form to create credentials.
4. Use the login form to verify and access the system.

## Future Improvements

- Add persistent storage using localStorage or sessionStorage.
- Implement a backend server with database support for secure user management.
- Enhance UI with better styling and validation feedback.
